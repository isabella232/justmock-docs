# Mock Non-Abstract Classes 

With JustMock Lite, you can mock non-abstract classes and their virtual members. The API enables you to mock the concrete implementations in the same way as you would mock an interface or an abstract class.

>With the commercial version of JustMock, in addition to the non-abstract classes you can also mock non-abstract and non-virtual members. Check the [Advanced Mocking | Non-Abstract and Non-Virtual]({%slug justmock/advanced-usage/concrete-mocking%}) topic.

To show you how to mock a non-abstract class and its members, let's take the following class that will be tested:

#### __[C#] Sample setup__

{{region ObjectMocking#VirtualSamples}}

    public class Customer
    {
        public Customer()
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException("Constructor");
        }
    
        public virtual int GetNumberOfOrders()
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }
    }
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB] Sample setup__

{{region ObjectMocking#VirtualSamples}}

    Public Class Customer
        Public Sub New()
            Throw New NotImplementedException("Constructor")
        End Sub
    
        Public Overridable Function GetNumberOfOrders() As IList(Of Integer)
            Throw New NotImplementedException()
        End Function
    End Class
{{endregion}}

Note, that we have declared a concrete class (`Customer`) which does not implement any interfaces. To test this class with **JustMock Lite**, you should make sure that all class members are `virtual`. 

#### __[C#] Example 1: Mock virtual member of concrete class__

{{region ObjectMocking#MockingVirtual}}

    [TestMethod]
    [ExpectedException(typeof(NotImplementedException))]
    public void ShouldCallOriginalForVirtualExactlyOnce()
    {
        //Arrange
        // Create a mock of the object
        var customerMock = Mock.Create<Customer>();
        // Arrange your expectations
        Mock.Arrange(() => customerMock.GetNumberOfOrders()).CallOriginal().OccursOnce();
    
        //Act
        customerMock.GetNumberOfOrders();
    
        //Assert
        Mock.Assert(customerMock);
    }
{{endregion}}

#### __[VB] Example 1: Mock virtual member of concrete class__

  {{region ObjectMocking#MockingVirtual}}

    <TestMethod>
    <ExpectedException(GetType(NotImplementedException))>
    Public Sub ShouldCallOriginalForVirtualExactlyOnce()
        ' Arrange
        ' Create a mock of the object
        Dim customerMock = Mock.Create(Of Customer)()
        ' Arrange your expectations
        Mock.Arrange(Function() customerMock.GetNumberOfOrders()).CallOriginal().OccursOnce()
        
        ' Act
        customerMock.GetNumberOfOrders()
        
        ' Assert
        Mock.Assert(customerMock)
    End Sub
{{endregion}}

Note that, in the [Arrange]({%slug justmock/basic-usage/arrange-act-assert%}) part of this example, we use the [CallOriginal]({%slug justmock/basic-usage/mock/call-original%}) and [Occurs]({%slug justmock/basic-usage/asserting-occurrence%}) methods. This example shows how JustMock allows us to add behavior checking - it will call the original `GetNumberOfOrders()` method, verifying that the method call is made only once.
